DESCRIPTION
Weather Dashboard Using OpenWeatherMap API and Dash

Project Overview

This project is a Weather Dashboard that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in an interactive web-based format using Dash and Plotly. It provides users with a 5-day weather forecast, displaying key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dashboard also includes summary statistics to give users an overview of the average, minimum, and maximum values of these parameters.

This application is useful for individuals and organizations looking for a quick and visually appealing way to monitor weather trends in any city worldwide.

Key Features

Real-Time Weather Data Fetching

Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for any city.

Provides a 5-day forecast at 3-hour intervals.

Graphical Representation

Displays temperature trends using Plotly's Scatter Plot.

Provides an easy-to-understand visualization of weather patterns over time.

Summary Statistics

Calculates and displays:

Average Temperature, Maximum & Minimum Temperature

Average Humidity, Maximum & Minimum Humidity

Average Wind Speed, Maximum & Minimum Wind Speed

User Input for City Selection

Allows users to enter the name of any city to fetch its weather forecast.

Interactive Web Dashboard

Built using Dash, allowing users to view and analyze data interactively.

Runs locally on a web browser for easy access.

Technical Implementation

1. Fetching Data from OpenWeatherMap API

The application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided API key.

It retrieves weather data in JSON format, which includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and timestamps.

The response is then parsed and stored for further analysis and visualization.

2. Data Processing

The raw data is processed to extract essential weather parameters.

Timestamps are converted into a readable date-time format.

Statistics such as average, maximum, and minimum values are computed for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

3. Visualization Using Plotly and Dash

The temperature trend is visualized using a Scatter Plot.

Dashâ€™s HTML components and Graph components are used to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

The dashboard dynamically updates based on the fetched data.

Technologies Used

Python - Primary programming language for data fetching and processing.

Requests - To interact with the OpenWeatherMap API and fetch weather data.

Dash - Framework for building interactive web applications.

Plotly - For creating dynamic visualizations.

Datetime - To handle date and time conversions.

OpenWeatherMap API - Provides real-time weather data.
