# Pyton Task-1
# DESCRIPTION
This project is a **Weather Forecast Dashboard** built using **Dash, Plotly, and OpenWeatherMap API**, allowing users to fetch and visualize **5-day weather forecasts** for any city. It retrieves real-time weather data, processes key parameters like **temperature, humidity, and wind speed**, and displays a summary along with an interactive temperature trend chart. The application ensures proper error handling, making it robust against API failures or incorrect city names.  

The dashboard features a clean, interactive interface where users can view weather trends over time. It calculates and presents key statistics, including **average, maximum, and minimum values** for temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The temperature trend is plotted dynamically using **Plotly**, enhancing the user experience with interactive visual insights.  

This project demonstrates practical usage of **APIs, data visualization, and web-based interactive applications** in Python. Future enhancements could include multi-city comparisons, additional weather parameters, and improved UI styling.
